    <h1>A serverless adventure</h1>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Based on the work done by <a href="https://github.com/dwmkerr/spaceinvaders">Dave Kerr</a>, AWS Alien Attack is a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/">serverless</a> application developed to support our partners in discussions, learning, and tasting
        different
        AWS services.</p>
    <p>The game is in fact an event source, which produces data that needs to be ingested, processed, stored, and
        analyzed. In practice, you can use the application to exercise your understanding about AWS services and to
        explore the different serverless architectures for games, IoT, financial transactions, and more.</p>
    <p>While playing, each player will be sending a payload of approximately <b>120 bytes</b>, at an average rate of
        <b>53 events/s</b> in playing time. We wanted to have multiple players playing together, and to give it a
        competition flavor, and be as cheap as possible, without hurting the principles of a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/">well-architected</a>
        design.</p>
    <p>With this application we're inviting you to think about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>What are the options that I have for <span class="boldText">INGESTING</span>
        data?</li>
      <li>After the data is ingested, what are the options for <span class="boldText">PROCESSING</span>?</li>
      <li>For <span class="boldText">STORING</span> and <span class="boldText">QUERYING</span>,
        what are the best options? Should we use different sources for game-time
        and after game-time?</li>
      <li>If I want real-time processing, what means <span class="boldText">REAL-TIME</span>
        for me? What services and architectural strategies should I use for
        that?</li>
      <li>What are the <span class="boldText">COSTS</span> for the different
        choices?</li>
      <li>Are there <span class="boldText">SECURITY</span> implications of my
        choice?</li>
      <li>Which one is the best for <b>my use case</b>, and for <b>my project
          constraints?</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The application will be used to support the deliverables of workshops and
      bootcamps for AWS partners and AWS-attached educational programs.</p>
    <p>This example DOES NOT apply the best practices for development, and the
      architecture was designed considering some assumptions. The idea is to use
      this code and architecture as a starting poing for discussion, evolution,
      study, and training.</p>
